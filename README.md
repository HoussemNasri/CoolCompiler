# Cool Compiler
I wrote this compiler while attending CS143[^cs] compiler construction course on *edx.org*.
The course is divided into four assignments. In each assignment, we implement one phase of the compilation process. All phases are being tested separately using automated scripts.

## Built with
- [Java](https://dev.java/) - The main programming language
- [JLex](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/) - Scanner generator
- [Java-CUP](http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/) - Parser generator
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) - Testing scripts, but why perl?
