# Cool Compiler
I wrote this compiler while attending CS143[^CS143] compiler construction course by Stanford on *edx.org*.
The course is divided into four assignments. In each assignment, we implement one phase of the compilation process. All phases are being tested separately using automated scripts

## Built with
- [Java](https://dev.java/) - The main programming language
- [JLex](https://dev.java/) - Scanner generator
- [Java-CUP](https://dev.java/) - Parser generator

[^CS143]:
      [CS143: Compilers][CS143] - Stanford's course in the practical and theoretical aspects of compiler construction
